# An Arcade Idle Prototype

The prototype demonstrates the core mechanics of an Arcade Idle game:

* Item collection and stacking

* Machine-driven item production and transformation

* A modular item storage system

* Character-to-machine item interaction

* AI Workers that autonomously collect and deliver items

I'm sharing this as a portfolio piece to showcase my system design and gameplay architecture approach.
